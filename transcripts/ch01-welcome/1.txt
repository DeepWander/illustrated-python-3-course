00:00 Welcome to Python 3, An Illustrated Tour.
00:02 I'm Matt Harrison and I'll be your host
00:04 through this nice trip on the new features of Python 3.
00:07 Let me just give you an introduction
00:09 about what we're going to cover in this course.
00:11 We're going to talk about the changes and new features in Python 3.
00:14 So if you've been using Python 2 for a while and transitioned to 3
00:18 or you've started using 3, but aren't aware
00:21 of all the new features, this course is for you.
00:24 Let me tell you a little bit about myself.
00:26 I am the author of various Python books.
00:28 I wrote the best-selling Illustrated Guide to Python 3.
00:31 I have books on Pandas as well as the Tiny Python Notebook.
00:34 I run a company called MetaSnake and I do Consulting and training for them.
00:38 So I've trained companies big and small
00:41 and I'm really used to seeing how people cope with Python
00:44 and how people cope with the new features.
00:46 I ran the Utah Python user group for five years.
00:49 I've been using python since 2000
00:52 and I tweet about Python with my username @_ _mharrison_ _.
00:56 Who is this course for?
00:58 Well, it's for old Python programmers
01:00 or those who have been using Python 2
01:02 and maybe have transitioned a Python 3
01:04 but are still programming it as if it were Python 2.
01:07 It's also for new Python programmers, those who are just getting started
01:10 and want to sort of understand better the features
01:13 and cool syntax and benefits that Python 3 provides.
01:17 So in general, this course is aimed for all those
01:19 who want to leverage the latest features of Python.
01:22 Let's talk about what we're going to cover in this course.
01:25 We're going to talk virtual environments
01:27 how you can make use of Pipenv in a Windows or Unix environment.
01:31 We'll also be talking about Fstrings and how you can take advantage of those,
01:35 great new feature in Python 3.
01:37 We'll also talk about what has changed in numbers since Python 2
01:41 some of the things that are happening under the covers
01:43 as well as some other features that you can take advantage of.
01:46 We'll talk about classes, we'll dive into Super and learn how that works.
01:51 We'll also talk about some of the new dunder methods in classes.
01:54 We'll talk about functions, we'll talk about keyword only arguments
01:57 and we'll get into some of the fun stuff there.
02:00 We'll look into the standard libraries
02:02 some of the new libraries in the standard library,
02:04 we'll look at the statistics module, we'll look at the enom module.
02:07 We'll look at the pathlib module and show some examples from those.
02:11 We'll also talk about some of the new syntax in Python 3
02:14 that isn't available and why you might want to use that.
02:18 We'll look at the new async library,
02:20 we'll talk about how that functions under the covers, the mechanisms that that's using
02:24 and we'll look at cool things like asynchronous context managers,
02:27 asynchronous iterators and asynchronous generators.
02:30 We'll also dive into annotations and see how you can take advantage
02:33 of this cool new feature to make your code more robust.
02:37 In addition, we'll look at unicode,
02:39 this is native in Python 3
02:41 and we'll see some of the features that Python 3 supports
02:44 and allows you to do with the new Unicode functionality.
02:47 We'll also look at some of the new annotation tools
02:50 that allow you to take advantage of the annotation syntax.
02:53 And we'll also talk about the new features like generalized unpacking
02:58 and show some examples of that.
03:00 So in addition to content, which I think is pretty good,
03:03 there's also a lot of labs for all these concepts
03:07 and you get to try your hand at these Labs
03:10 there are some cool self-correcting assignments that you'll get to do.
03:13 And in addition, there are content walks through all the solutions to those
03:17 as well as the walks through common errors that people have
03:20 when they come across these things.
03:22 It's a great way to try your hand out
03:24 and learn these new things and take advantage of them.
03:26 I hope you enjoy this class and I hope that it makes your Python code
03:31 much cleaner, easier to read and more robust.
03:34 Enjoy.
