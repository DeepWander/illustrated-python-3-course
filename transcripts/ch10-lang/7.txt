00:01 One of the general themes of Python 3 is laziness
00:03 and so a lot of functions that returned lists in Python 2
00:07 are now lazy and behave as iterators,
00:11 either returning generators or views or something that is iterable.
00:15 So map, filter and zip, and range are all examples of this.
00:20 In Python 2, these returned lists, that is no longer the case,
00:23 they don't return lists anymore,
00:26 they are iterables that you can loop over.
00:28 Similarly, a dictionary in Python 3 has keys, items and views,
00:34 these same methods existed in Python 2
00:36 but in Python 2 these returned lists of what was in there.
00:40 These are now views, views are slightly special
00:43 in that they reflect any updates that are made to the dictionaries.
00:46 So if you're looping over it and it's been updated in the meantime,
00:50 you should get some values that update as well.
