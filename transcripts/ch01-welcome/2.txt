00:01 I just want to share with you some motivation and some resources.
00:05 I've taught a bunch of people Python over the years
00:07 and I've found that most people learn best when they can
00:10 in addition to just listening or watching, they can try something out.
00:13 And so included with the course are a bunch of labs or assignments
00:16 for you to try out what we've talked about.
00:18 I would advise you not to look at the solution videos
00:21 which are included in the course until you've tried out the labs,
00:24 that's going to help you get the most out of the course.
00:28 Also, I want to give you this GitHub link here.
00:30 This will give you all the resources for the course.
00:33 So keep this handy while you're going through the course.
