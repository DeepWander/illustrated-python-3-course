00:00 In this video, we're going to talk about 3rd-party annotation tooling.
00:03 These are tools that are useful when using annotations that Python 3 supports.
00:08 We're going to look at a couple tools here one is MonkeyType,
00:12 this is created by the people at Instagram
00:14 and this is a tool that allows you to run your code
00:17 and as it's running, it will trace it and keep track of the types
00:20 and then it will generate some type information for you.
00:22 Similar project is called PyAnnotate, this is by Dropbox
00:26 and this is very similar, it does basically the same thing.
00:28 Basically the difference between these two is that MonkeyType is focused on Python 3,
00:33 whereas PyAnnotate has Python 2 support
00:36 because Dropbox has a lot of Python 2 code and they want to add types to it.
00:41 There's another tool called PyType, which is very similar to mypy,
00:45 it does type checking and we'll look at that as well.
00:48 We'll also look at mypy a little bit.
