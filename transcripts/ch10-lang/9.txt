00:00 Another thing that Python 3 gave us
00:02 is the lack of name leakage in comprehensions.
00:06 This is something you may not be aware of
00:09 but variables were created during comprehension creation in Python 2
00:13 so an example shown here is I've got a variable called x
00:18 and I am looping over range 5 in a list comprehension
00:21 using that same variable name x.
00:23 In Python 2, x after that list comprehension
00:28 would be the last value of the iteration.
00:31 In Python 3 that's no longer the case,
00:33 these variables used in list comprehensions
00:36 don't go into your local or global name space,
00:39 they stay isolated in your list comprehension.
00:42 So x will stay 10 in Python 3, a slight difference there.
00:46 Okay, that wraps up most of the changes,
00:48 we've seen in bunch of the other videos in this course,
00:51 a bunch of the new features and functionalities of Python 3,
00:54 I just wanted to make sure that we talked about some of the other changes
00:57 that weren't easily found in peps or whatnot,
01:01 but are some things that you should be aware of.
