00:00 Python has what's called gil, and gil has a couple bonuses
00:03 or things that it gives you, it gives you simplified garbage collection.
00:07 It also allows you to avoid none thread safe code with other threads,
00:11 but it has some drawbacks, one is that you can only run
00:14 one native thread at a time on Python.
00:17 So even if you have multiple CPUs on your computer,
00:19 you're only going to be able to take advantage of one of them
00:22 using threading in Python, if you use a library called multiprocessing
00:26 that gets around it by launching multiple processes, Python processes
00:30 and each one of those processes can use the CPU.
00:33 There's a little bit more overhead to that
00:35 because it's got to pass around the information, it can't share it as easily.
00:39 Another minus of the gil is that if you have cpu-bound code
00:42 it's going to be a little bit slower and this sort of relates to the other one
00:46 that we can't parallelize them easily from Python.
